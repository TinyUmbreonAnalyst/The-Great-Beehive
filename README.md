# The-Great-Beehive
Just a funny name for initial coding challenge.

My code is allows anyone to input either a Roman Numeral or integer between 0 and 3999, (if it is not either,
the code will give an error message, but not exit the program) and then prints out the input's decimal number if it
was a Roman Numeral, or its Roman Numeral if the input was a valid integer. The program will continue to run until the user
indicates they want to exit, which is done by typing either exit, q, or quit.
